<b>vkThread</b> is a javascript plugin, which allows you to execute any function of a your code in a thread. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="color_blue">Standalone function:</span> simply pass it as an argument to the <b>vkthread()</b>, and get the result in a callback function. You don't need to create a separate file for each thread, like you normally do with a regular worker. 
</p>
<p><span class="color_blue">Object's method:</span> <b>vkthread</b> accepts context as an optional parameter and executes function in it's context. Simply pass the object as a context, that's it.</p>
<p><span class="color_blue">Function with dependencies:</span> <b>vkthread</b> accepts a list of filenames as an optional argument and imports these files in the thread before the function is calling </p>
<p>
Here is a basic example:
<pre><code data-language="javascript">
	var foo, bar;
	
	function sum(num1, num2) {
		return num1 + num2;
	}
	
	/* execute function foo() here, in the main thread. */
	foo = sum(2,3);
	
	/* open a new thread and execute function foo() in this thread. */
	vkthread.exec(sum, [2,3], function(data){ bar = data; });
</code>	</pre>
</p>
