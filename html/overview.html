<p>
<b>vkThread</b> is a javascript plugin, which allows you to execute any function of a your code in a thread. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="color_blue">Standalone function:</span> simply pass it as an argument to the <b>vkthread()</b>, and get the result in a callback function. You don't need to create a separate file for each thread, like you normally do with a regular worker. 
</p>
<p><span class="color_blue">Object's method:</span> <b>vkthread</b> accepts context as an optional parameter and executes function in its context. Simply pass the object as a context, that's it.</p>
<p><span class="color_blue">Function with dependencies:</span> <b>vkthread</b> accepts a list of filenames as an optional argument and imports these files in the thread before the function is calling </p>
<p>
Here is a basic example:
<pre><code data-language="javascript">function sum(num1, num2) {
	return num1 + num2;
}</code></pre>
	
In the main thread you execute it this way:
<pre><code data-language="javascript">var foo = sum(2,3);</code></pre>

Now, let's open a new thread and execute function sum(...) in this thread.
<pre><code data-language="javascript">vkthread.exec(sum, [2,3], function(data){ var foo = data; })</code>	</pre></p>

<b>vkThread</b> is built on HTML5 "Worker" technology.  It also incorporates <a href="http://www.eslinstructor.net/jsonfn/" target="_blank" class="color_blue"  title="Converts jsvascript object with functions into a string and vise versa.">JSONfn</a> code to implement key tasks.<br/>
In spite of technical complexity, plugin is super compact. Development version (plain text with comments) is less than 2k. I don't care to minify it.
